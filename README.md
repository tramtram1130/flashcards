# Flashcards

### Abstract:
Flashcards is a CLI (command line interface) game that generates a multiple choice quiz designed to test the player's knowledge of Javascript concepts and vocabulary. The result of each anwer is given - correct or incorrect. After all the questions have been answered the player will be given their percentage of correct answers.

### Context:
This project was completed during my first week of Mod 2 at Turing School of Software and Design. The project took me 9 hours to complete. The spec for this project can be found [here](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/flash-cards.html).

### Contributors:
- Dana Truong ([GitHub](https://github.com/tramtram1130), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dana-truong-a1b35a250/))

### Learning Goals:
- Contribute code to an partially constructed object-oriented application
- Follow spec/prompts to make a working application
- Implement ES6 classes
- Write modular, reusable code that follows SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)
- Implement a robust testing suite using TDD

### Technology Used
- JavaScript
- Mocha
- Chai
- VS Code
- Github

### Wins:
- I was wary of building classes from scratch and having it all seamlessly interactive with one another so seeing it all work smoothly was a definite win!
- The test codes didn't look dry at all with how many repetitive mock executions there were until I discovered beforeEach hooks. The test files are now easier on the eye.

### Challenges:
- Before going into the project, complex class to class interaction was a challenging concept for me. After creating several classes on multiple occasions, I have solidified my knowledge about the concept.
- At first, the code was repetitive, but after a considerable amount of refactoring, I am very proud for how clean the code is.
